# Overview of Driver Technology

The sections below contain links to historic, current, and proposed future specifications. 

Unlinked entries in the lists below generally represent known future artifacts that have not yet been designed or current or historic artifacts that have no specification available.
Such entries exist for completeness.


## PackStream

PackStream is a binary [presentation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presentation_layer) format for the exchange of richly typed data.
It provides a syntactic layer for the Bolt messaging protocol.

- [PackStream v1 Specification](specs/packstream-specification-v1.md) (Neo4j 3.0 to 3.5)
- PackStream v2 Specification (Neo4j 4.0)


## Jolt

Jolt is a proposed PackStream spin-off that provides identical data exchange capabilities to PackStream within a pure [JSON](http://json.org/) context.
This introduces readability at the expense of a slightly higher byte count.

Jolt is intended primarily for use over an HTTP connection and can be useful within network environments that have a requirement for the automatic inspection of traffic.  
 
- Jolt v1 Specification


## Bolt

Bolt is an [application protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_layer) for the execution of database queries via a database query language, such as [Cypher](https://www.opencypher.org/).
It is generally carried over a regular [TCP](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc793) or [WebSocket](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API) connection.

Bolt inherits its type system from PackStream, over which its messages are generally carried.
Each version of Bolt provides a number of type system extensions, via the PackStream type extension mechanism.  

### Bolt Handshake

All Bolt connections begin with a handshake to negotiate which version of the messaging protocol to use.
Following a successful negotiation, the agreed messaging protocol then takes ownership of the connection for the remainder of its lifetime.
The handshake itself is not versioned. 

- [Bolt Handshake Protocol Specification](specs/bolt-handshake-protocol-specification.md)

### Bolt v1 (Neo4j 3.0 to 3.3)

Version 1 corresponds to the first releases of the messaging protocol and the type system.

- [Bolt Messaging Protocol Specification v1](specs/bolt-messaging-protocol-specification-v1.md)
- Bolt Type System Extensions v1

### Bolt v2 (Neo4j 3.4)

Version 2 incorporates an updated type system, but retains the messaging protocol from version 1.

- Bolt Type System Extensions v2

### Bolt v3 (Neo4j 3.5)

Version 3 incorporates both an updated type system and an updated messaging protocol.

- [Bolt Messaging Protocol Specification v3](specs/bolt-messaging-protocol-specification-v3.md)
- Bolt Type System Extensions v3

### Bolt v4 (Neo4j 4.0)

Version 4 incorporates both an updated type system and an updated messaging protocol.

- Bolt Messaging Protocol Specification v4
- Bolt Type System Extensions v4
